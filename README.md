# Real-Time Object Size Estimation using YOLOv8

## üìå Introduction

This project implements a **real-time object detection and size estimation system** using **YOLOv8**. It estimates the **physical dimensions (width and height)** of detected objects in a video stream using a predefined **pixel-to-centimeter ratio**. This is a cost-effective alternative to complex calibration methods.

## üéØ Project Goals

* Build a **real-time object detection system** using YOLOv8.
* Estimate object **dimensions (in cm)** using a fixed pixel-to-cm ratio.
* Provide a simple and low-cost alternative to traditional calibration-based systems.

## üß© Problem Definition

Most object detection systems only identify objects‚Äîthey don't estimate their real-world sizes. In industrial settings, manual measurement is often time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to **automate size estimation** without requiring extra hardware or complex camera calibration.

## üîç Methodology

1. **Model Selection**: Use YOLOv8 for object detection.
2. **Video Capture**: Capture real-time video from a webcam.
3. **Object Detection**: Apply YOLO to detect objects and extract bounding box coordinates.
4. **Size Estimation**: Convert bounding box dimensions from pixels to centimeters using a predefined ratio.
5. **Visualization**: Display object label, confidence score, and estimated dimensions on the video feed.
