# Real-Time Object Size Estimation using YOLOv8

## Introduction

This project implements a **real-time object detection and size estimation system** using **YOLOv8**. It estimates the physical dimensions (width and height) of detected objects from a video stream using a predefined pixel-to-centimeter ratio. This is a cost-effective solution that avoids complex calibration techniques.

---

## Project Goals

* Implement a **real-time object detection system** using YOLOv8.
* Estimate **object dimensions (in cm)** using a fixed pixel-to-cm ratio.
* Provide a simple and low-cost alternative to traditional calibration-based systems.

## Problem Definition

Most object detection systems identify objects but do not estimate their real-world size. In industries, manual measurement is time-consuming and prone to error. This project aims to automate size estimation without additional hardware or complex camera calibration.

---

## Proposed Methodology

1. **Model Selection:** Use YOLOv8 for object detection.
2. **Video Capture:** Capture real-time video using a webcam.
3. **Detection:** Apply YOLO to detect objects and extract bounding box coordinates.
4. **Size Estimation:** Convert bounding box dimensions from pixels to cm using a fixed ratio.
5. **Visualization:** Display object name, confidence score, and estimated size on the video stream.

## Results

Examples:

* **Smartphone** detected ‚Üí Estimated Width: \~11.4 cm, Height: \~31.0 cm
* **Water Bottle** detected ‚Üí Dimensions displayed on live feed
* **Toothbrush** detected ‚Üí Estimated size shown in real-time

## Conclusion

The system successfully detects objects and estimates their dimensions using a fixed ratio. It is suitable for scenarios where approximate size estimation is sufficient.
